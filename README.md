# FxOSU API Spec

This repository contains the latest draft of the FxOSU API; a network API giving the client a way to determine the timing of their network requests by taking into consideration the environment of such a request and how it may impact both device efficiency and cost to the consumer.

You can preview the current version of the master branch [here](http://johnlzeller.github.com/fxosu-api/).
